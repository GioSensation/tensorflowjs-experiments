# Tensorflow.js experiments

Machine learning in the browser. Sounds scary? It's not.

These experiments are based on  [this great article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/09/machine-learning-front-end-developers-tensorflowjs/) by Charlie Gerard, and add a bit of functionality here and there, such as the use of the [LoremFlickr API](https://loremflickr.com) to get random pet data in the pretrained model example.
